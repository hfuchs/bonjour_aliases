Bonjour Aliases
==================

A project born of the burning desire to be backwards compatible --
served with a dash of bitterness.

Quick Start
--------------

On Debian, install daemontools or runit and symlink this directory under
/etc/service::

    apt-get install daemontools-run
    apt-get install libavahi-compat-libdnssd1 python-pip
    pip install pybonjour
    update-service --add /root/bonjour_aliases/ bonjour_aliases

See, if, on a different machine in the same physical net, you can see
the aliases::

    avahi-browse -a | grep [pattern]

Check status, shutdown and start service::

    svstat /etc/service/bonjour_aliases
    svc -d /etc/service/bonjour_aliases
    svc -u /etc/service/bonjour_aliases

Happy?


Long, Winding Story
--------------------------------------------------------------------


This project currently solves one and only one scenario: It creates
name-aliases to Bonjour records from already published records.  Say you
are running a printserver and it publishes your printers like this:

    printer1 @ my.domain

You discover that, after an innocuous update, the very same printserver,
for whatever reasons, starts publishing the very same printers with
records named like this[0]:

    printer1 @ my

Being the good sysadmin that I am, I wanted my users to not suffer the
inconvenience of discovering that they'd have to remove all Bonjour
printers only to add them again (thereby possibly losing their precious
settings).

The project conveniently includes a 'run' file that's suitable for
supervisors such as daemontools or runit.

[Note: Currently, names are hardcoded in the source code -- please do
contact me if you want a more generic version!]
